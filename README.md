## Sinhala fonts level definition by ICTA
Sinhala fonts are standardized into three different levels by ICTA, but this definition is only based on the functionality and it does not provide a clear identification of number of glyphs or coverage. We will try to define these here.			

Qoted from ICTA documentation 
TODO: Add links

```
**Level 1 fonts**
These fonts commonly used vowels, consonants and consonants with modifiers and they are intended to be used in mobile devices. This level supports special characters such as yansaya,rakaransaya and repaya and “ක්ෂ”**

**Level 2 fonts** 
These fonts shall have all the features of level one font and additionally support existing combination of Sinhala consonants with repaya. These fonts are intended for general applications such as documents and books.  

**Level 3 fonts**
These fonts support special characters and all combinations of strokes with conjuncts including “repaya+ispilla” combinations and touching conjuncts. These fonts fully support Pali and Sanskrit langauges and are intended for historic or classical Sinhala documents.
